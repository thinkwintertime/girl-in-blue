### What's a girl to do, but explore the deep blue.

# About me

Hi! I'm 21, a senior at Stanford, and taking a gap year to explore the world. Follow my journey as I explore every curious avenue of southeast Asia.

# Philosophy

What constitutes success? Was it getting perfect grades throughout high school? At that time it seemed like the world to me. Now it's embarassing to even bring up. Was it playing your sport to the highest level and getting recruited to a top university? Beyond the love I have for my team, I no longer feel much passion for my sport.

Then, in university you are presented with a buffet of options. I chose one of the hardest majors and prevailed. I just landed my dream internship. What's next? To get rich and married and have kids and live in suburbia working my 9-5? It seems the further we go, the further these elusive objective gets pushed.

When the world order relentlessly pushed me towards milestone after milestone, I followed course. But now my college life is coming to an end and it feels like I've reached the precipice of my life.

**If life is a marathon and you are fortunate enough to be granted the speed to run twice as fast, stop and run up the nearby mountains! Get a better vantage point and *choose* your path with care.**
